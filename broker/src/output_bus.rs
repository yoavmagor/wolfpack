//! Per-session live-output fanout primitive.
//!
//! `OutputBus` couples a small ring buffer (for `since_seq` replay) with a
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel (for live fanout to attached subscribers).
//! The drainer thread owns publishing; subscriptions atomically capture both
//! a replay snapshot of the ring and a live receiver under a single lock so
//! no chunk is ever observed twice and no chunk in flight is silently
//! dropped between snapshot-time and receiver-attach.
//!
//! Closure: when the drainer exits (PTY EOF) it calls `close()`, which
//! drops the inner broadcast sender and signals any thread blocked on
//! `wait_closed()`. This is the canonical "drainer is done, every byte the
//! child produced has been ingested" handshake — used by tests to
//! synchronise on snapshot inspection without sleep loops.
//!
//! Lagged subscribers: tokio's broadcast channel returns `RecvError::Lagged`
//! when a slow receiver falls more than `broadcast_capacity` chunks behind.
//! Callers are expected to recover by re-querying the ring with the last
//! seq they observed (or by hitting `snapshot` for a hard re-sync). The bus
//! itself does not paper over lag — it surfaces it.
