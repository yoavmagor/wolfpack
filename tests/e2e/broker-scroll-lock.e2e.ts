/**
 * Regression: scrollback drifts past user's viewport while output streams.
 *
 * Reported symptom: with the agent (or any process) producing output, scroll
 * up with trackpad — the FIRST visible row keeps changing as new lines push
 * into scrollback, even though the user scrolled away from the bottom to
 * READ that specific row. Visually presents as "the first line is duplicated"
 * because the user sees a row at viewport row 0, then on next frame that row
 * has moved to viewport row 1 and a different row has taken row 0.
 *
 * Root cause: public/app.ts monkey-patches `term.scrollToBottom` to no-op
 * while `_userScrolledUp = true`. ghostty-web calls scrollToBottom on every
 * `writeInternal()`. Without the call, ghostty's viewportY stays pinned but
 * `scrollbackLength` grows as new rows are pushed off the live screen — so
 * the SAME viewportY now resolves to a DIFFERENT absolute scrollback row.
 *
 * Correct behavior: when scroll-locked and new content arrives, viewportY
 * should INCREMENT by the number of lines that just got pushed into
 * scrollback, so the visible window stays anchored to the same absolute
 * scrollback rows.
 *
 * This test:
 *  1. opens a shell session
 *  2. fills scrollback with a counted sequence of rows
 *  3. scrolls up so user sees a known marker row at viewport row 0
 *  4. starts a streaming output loop in the background
 *  5. waits for streaming to push lines into scrollback
 *  6. asserts the marker row is STILL at viewport row 0 (i.e. the visible
 *     window stayed anchored to the same content the user was reading)
 *
 * Fails today because of the broken scroll-lock invariant. Will pass once
 * scrollToBottom is replaced with viewportY-bump-on-write logic.
 *
 * Requires: wolfpack-broker binary (guarded by skipIfNoBroker).
 * Desktop-only: trackpad/wheel scroll path; mobile uses touch (different code path).
